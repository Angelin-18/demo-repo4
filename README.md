#LEARN GIT
## to create repo locally

1. Create a new folder(repo) in  VS code.   
2. Change path to new repo that you have created.
3. Initialize git onto the   folder.
4. Create a file to push content.
5. Give access to git to track file.
6. Commit changes.
7. Push the file live to git.
 
 [...you can only push if there is a space in Github to push file, so create an empty repo in github...]

 ...otherwise git says:"I have no idea where to push this to"...

7. (a) After creating remote repo, set the local file to go to remote repo. code:[git remote add origin "link"]
   (b) check its connection [code:git remote -v] and push it to main .

   ## to learn branching

   1. Check branches using ..'git branch'.
   2. Create a subbranch and switch to it... 'git checkout -b subbranch_name'
   3. MODIFY YOUR MAIN BRANCH CODE LIKE WHAT I AM DOING NOW..
   4. Commit changes.
   5. Push to git.
